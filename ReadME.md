## 🔍 What I Did

### 🐍 Python — Data Cleaning & EDA
- Loaded and inspected 100,000 rows of raw retail data

- Performed exploratory analysis across categories, regions, years, outlet types, and segments
- Exported clean dataset for SQL and Power BI

### 🗄️ SQL — Business Query Analysis
- Queried sales and profit trends by category, region, year, and state
- Analyzed discount impact on profit margins using grouping and aggregations
- Identified top performing sub-categories and customer segments
- Used joins, aggregations, filtering, and sorting

### 📊 Power BI — Interactive Dashboard
- Built KPI cards for Total Sales, Total Profit, Avg Margin, Total Orders
- Visualized yearly sales trends, category performance, and regional breakdown
- Created discount impact chart showing margin erosion

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

**1. Discounts are hurting profit significantly**
- Orders with no discount earn **20% margin**
- Orders with 41–50% discount earn only **10.95% margin**
- Every 10% increase in discount = ~2% margin loss
- **Recommendation:** Cap discounts at 20% to protect profitability

**2. Sales are declining post-2021**
- Sales peaked in 2021 at ₹504.7M and have dropped each year since
- **Recommendation:** Investigate root cause — pricing strategy, competition, or demand shift

**3. February is consistently the weakest month**
- February dips every single year between ₹37.8M – ₹39.8M
- **Recommendation:** Run targeted promotions in February to boost sales

**4. Furniture has the lowest profit margin**
- Despite decent sales, Furniture margin (14.90%) lags all other categories
- **Recommendation:** Review discount policy and pricing for Furniture

**5. All regions and segments perform equally**
- East, West, North, South are within 3% of each other
- Consumer and Corporate segments are virtually identical
- **Recommendation:** Focus on discount reduction rather than regional targeting
